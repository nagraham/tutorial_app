# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Main Tutorial Sample Application

This is the main tutorial application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). nagraham is developing this while following along with the tutorial.  

## nagraham notes
Because this application is instructive rather than productive, and because it is only for nagraham's use, most of the comments will actually be notes about Ruby, Rails, RSpec, and other elements. In other words, don't expect production-grade anything from this application. It's just practice.
